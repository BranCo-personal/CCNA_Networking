DMVPN:

REquriments to work
-- mGRE & IPsec tunnel can be establish
	- IKE policy 
	-- crypto isakmp policy 
-- NAT , You must use IPsec transport mode on transform set
- Must set up 
-- mpls ip

DMVPN Configuration:
en
conf t
crypto ipsec profile <name>
set trandorm-set <transform-set-name>
set identity
set security association lifetime seconds 1890 (Overrides the gloabl lifetime val for ipsec)
set pfs <group#> (if not set default of group1 will be used)

After that is set up now you confiure the Hub and Spoke


HUB Configuration:
en
conf t
interface tunnel <#>(specifies the number of tunnel interface that you want to create)
ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0 (All hubs and spokes that are in same subnet)
ip mtu 1400 (set the MTU size of ip packets)
ip nhrp authentication donttell (Authentication password, set on all hubs and spokes)
ip nhrp map multicast dynamic (NHRP auto add spoke routers to multicast mapping)
ip nhrp network-id <#> (EXP:99; specifies global unique 32-bit network ID)
tunnel source <interface> (sets Source IP for Tunnel)
tunnel key <key-number> (ID the tunnel key; Must be set on all hubs and spokes)
tunnel mode gre multipoint (sets encapsulation mode to mGRE)
tunnel protection ipsec profile <name> (same name above ^^; Associates tunnel with IPsec)
bandwidth <#> (setting to 1000+ is critical for EIGRP protocols)
ip tcp adjust-mss <1360> (set specififies for segment size; 500 - 1400)
ip nhrp holdtime <#> (Set advertiment of NBMA; Range: 300-600)
delay <#> (Change EIGRP routing metric for routes; Rec:1000)


Spoke Configuration:
